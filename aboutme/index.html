    <p>Advanced Technology Degree. I like music. I'm single. No children. I work in Construction. I study part time. BYU Idaho
         helps me remember that Zion will be soon. I can't remember the acronym for my degree, at the moment...!? Computer 
         technology is the future. I didn't know much about it, which is why I chose it. I hope to create something interesting
          and beneficial from what I learn in my degree. I have been a member all of my life. I served a mission in Adelaide, 
          South Australia.
